# Kali-xfce-windows10-theme
Kali-Linux provides a GREAT windows 10 theme with Kali-undercover, but did NOT upload it to github. I copied it. Here it is!

Oh, and the s5 version has larger borders, so you can GRAB THEM easier!!! (stands for size 5)

# Install theme on your computer
click the green code button, download zip, open your file explorer, right click and extract it, now copy the folder "Kali-Windows-10-theme" to "/usr/share/themes/" with the admin file explorer. (To get admin file explorer type "sudo" in the command line before the name of your preffered file explorer. With xfce it is probably "sudo thunar") now you can go into your settings or appearance settings and apply the theme.
